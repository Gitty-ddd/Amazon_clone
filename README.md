# amazon_clone

A new Flutter project.
Welcome to my Amazon Clone App project â€” a full-stack e-commerce application inspired by Amazon, built using Flutter for the frontend and Node.js + Express + MongoDB for the backend. This is a practice project to explore and master full-stack mobile app development, responsive UI design , and modern state management in Flutter.
